            <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Kids Math Wizard's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
                information we may collect from you across our website, <a
                    href="https://kidsmathwizard.com">kidsmathwizard.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not collect any personal identifiable information (PII)</strong> from users. You do not
                need to create an account to use our service.</p>
            <p>All math worksheets are generated locally in your browser or on our stateless servers. We do not store
                the worksheets you create.</p>

            <h2>2. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
            <p>We use standard local storage cookies to remember your preferences (like your last selected math
                operation) to improve your experience. We may use third-party services like Google Analytics to
                understand website traffic, which may use anonymous identifiers.</p>

            <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
            <p>We work with third-party advertising partners (such as Google AdSense) to serve ads. These partners may
                use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website or other websites on the internet.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on
                    their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>
                <li>Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ads Settings</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our website is a tool for parents and teachers. We do not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable
                Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of
                information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best
                efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.</p>
